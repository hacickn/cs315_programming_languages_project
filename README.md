# cs315_programming_languages_project
* It consists of the project 1 and 2 which was given in the cs315 course. Project 2 is continuity of the project 1.

## Project 1
Designing a language to create an adventure game.
### Language Design
- variable identifiers
- assignment operator
- expressions (arithmetic, relational, boolean, their combination)
- precedence, associativity of the operators
- loops
- conditional statements
- statements for input / output (to ask questions and read answers)
- function definitions and function calls.
- comments
### Lexical Analysis
It is a lexical Analysis implementation for to preparing code to parser.

### Example Programs
- An adventure game where the goal is to escape from the monsters and find the treasures in a castle.
- A map of a castle with 5 rooms, and specify the transitions between rooms.
- The treasures and monsters into the rooms.
- Some wealth and strength
- Repeat the followings accordingly until the player is dead or quits the program
+ inform player about room contents and own status
+ move from one room to another considering walls and doors
+ pick up treasure and increase wealth
+ fight monster and reduce strength
+ eat food to have strength
+ use tools
+ buy food or tools
-Inform the user about the final score: 2.wealth + 3.strength

## Project 2

### Revised and Augmented Language Design
- variable identifiers
- assignment operator
- expressions (arithmetic, relational, boolean, their combination)
- precedence, associativity of the operators
- loops
- conditional statements
- statements for input / output (to ask questions and read answers)
- function definitions and function calls.
- comments
### Implementing the Parser
It is a parser implementation which is continuity of the lexical analysis.

### Example Program
Same with the project 1



*NOTE*
-Details can be found in the reports of the project1 and project 2.
